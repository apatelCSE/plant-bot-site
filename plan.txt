Components of the React App:
- Robot Builder Form (DONE)
- Task Center
- Leaderboard

Ideas:
- Maybe each task has a difficulty and that factors into the ranking
- Animations!!

"Changelog":

I started by hard-coding my own form to make it fully customizable 
and to help myself understand how React forms work. Now that I fully
understand how to write a form, I feel comfortable switching to a
Reactstrap-organized form, which will provide for a better user
experience.

Now, I have a list of bots and their tasks to complete. Need to:
- Build a Task Center where you can click on the task and it starts
- Remove the task from the list when it's complete
