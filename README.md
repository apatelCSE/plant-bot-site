# Welcome to Bot-O-Mat!
Hello, world! This is the source code of my solution to the Bot-O-Mat challenge. This challenge allowed me to hone in my React skills to provide an enjoyable user experience, and I was able to play around with the Reactstrap library to add features that contribute to the application's aesthetic quality and responsiveness. I'm excited to take the skills I used in implementing this project and apply them to my personal site. Read below to run a demo from your machine!

## How to Install
1. Install Yarn from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/.
2. Clone/Download the repository onto your local machine.
3. Use the command prompt to navigate to the main directory, `cd bot-o-mat-apatelCSE`.
4. Navigate to the site files using `cd bot-site`.
5. Run `yarn install` to install the project's dependencies and load the source code. 
6. Run `yarn start` to launch a demo of the application on a live server.
7. Create your first bot in the Bot Initializer to fill the Task Center and Leaderboard!

# Bot-O-Mat Challenge Instructions
Use any language to complete this challenge. The implementation is up to you: it can be a command-line application or have a graphical interface.

Your application should collect a name and robot type from the types we list below. For each, it should create a Robot of the type the user chooses, e.g. Larry, Bipedal. 

Given the list of tasks below, your application should then assign the Robot a set of five tasks, all of which complete after a duration that we show in milliseconds. 



- Collect a name and robot type from user.
- Instantiate a Robot of the type provided by the user with the name provided by the user
  - for example: Bipedal, Larry
- Set up methods on Robot to complete tasks from the provided list

## Robot
Robot completes tasks and removes them from the list when they are done (i.e. enough time has passed since starting the task).

## Tasks
Tasks have a description and an estimated time to complete.

```
[
  {
    description: 'do the dishes',
    eta: 1000,
  },{
    description: 'sweep the house',
    eta: 3000,
  },{
    description: 'do the laundry',
    eta: 10000,
  },{
    description: 'take out the recycling',
    eta: 4000,
  },{
    description: 'make a sammich',
    eta: 7000,
  },{
    description: 'mow the lawn',
    eta: 20000,
  },{
    description: 'rake the leaves',
    eta: 18000,
  },{
    description: 'give the dog a bath',
    eta: 14500,
  },{
    description: 'bake some cookies',
    eta: 8000,
  },{
    description: 'wash the car',
    eta: 20000,
  },
]
```

## Types
```
{ 
  UNIPEDAL: 'Unipedal',
  BIPEDAL: 'Bipedal',
  QUADRUPEDAL: 'Quadrupedal',
  ARACHNID: 'Arachnid',
  RADIAL: 'Radial',
  AERONAUTICAL: 'Aeronautical'
}
```

## Features to add once the core functionality is complete
Be creative and have fun! Use this list or create your own features.
- Allow users to create multiple robots at one time
- Create a leaderboard for tasks completed by each Robot
- Create tasks specific for each robot type, this could work in conjunction with the leaderboard. For e.g. robots that are assigned tasks that their type can’t perform won’t get “credit” for finishing the task.
- Add persistance for tasks, bots and leaderboard stats
