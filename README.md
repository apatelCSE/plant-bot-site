# Welcome to PlantLife!
Hello, world! This is the source code of PlantLife, a React application I built based on a technical challenge I recently completed. This challenge allowed me to hone in my React skills to provide an enjoyable user experience, and I was able to play around with the Reactstrap library to add features that contribute to the application's aesthetic quality and responsiveness. One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning the difference between npm and yarn (I had mixed the two in my project, so there was definitely a lot of debugging involved!). I'm excited to take the skills I used in implementing this project and apply them to my personal site. Read below to run a demo from your machine!

## How to Install
1. Install Yarn from https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/.
2. Clone/Download the repository onto your local machine.
3. Use the command prompt to navigate to the main directory, `cd plant-bots`.
4. Navigate to the site files using `cd bot-site`.
5. Run `yarn install` to install the project's dependencies and load the source code. 
6. Run `yarn start` to launch a demo of the application on a live server.
7. If you receive a "Permission Denied" error for `react-scripts`, please run the command `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/react-scripts` to reset the permissions and run `yarn start` again.
7. Buy your first plant in the Plant Nursery to fill the Task Center and Leaderboard!
